Task 2
A note id may not be needed?

If you think of an entity as an object (like in OOP)
I do not need to have the size of that object as an attribute **inside** that specific entity.
If I want to find how many INSTANCES of that entity there are I can simply run an SQL command (frankly: COUNT * WHERE database = "INSTANCE")
